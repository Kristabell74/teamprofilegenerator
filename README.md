## Issues

Had issues with the old repo. I had a gitignore that was not being listened to and because I made so many copies of the repo on my computer to do my work I did not know where the original repo was on my computer. I may have even deleted it. I have no idea. I have had this problem with several repos because I do not want to loose the initial information. I have learned not to do that but may have to make several more repos for other projects that I have almost finished because of this issue. I deleted the old Team-Profile-Generator repo because git hub kept complaining of the node modules. I did not know how to fix the issue any other way so I created a new repo and transfered all of the work. I have leared a good lesson.
